# MyReads Project

This is the first project for Udacity's React Nanodegree course. The goal of this assignment is to develop a simple application using only React.

This is a React Project to organizing your virtual books (only cover and name for now). Here you can organize the books by shelf (Currently reading, Want to read and Read). Also you can search by a limited search terms. Is't very simple and intuitive to use.
